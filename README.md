Background:
Player will play in first person vision
I am a writer. I got into a car accident and couldn’t go home to attend my daughter’s 5th birthday, but my obsession brought me back to my room.
I want to get out of this room quickly, but I slowly realize who I am and why I am here.
Finally, I must complete all levels and escape the room. During the escape, hidden clues can be found. After finding all the clues, I can unlock the bonus and leave a note for my daughter.

First, the player is in the main room. 



Now it is in the morning scene.

Facilities in the main room:
Wall 1: tv set, cabinet, red bug
Wall 2: curtain, sash
Wall 3: case, cabinet, switch, green bug
Wall 4: front door, white bug, rug
Ceiling: garret door, ceiling light
Dining table: nothing

Special:
Nothing’s on the TV and nothing will happen if I open the sash, and nothing is on the table located in the dining room. Nothing will happen if I enter code:20120517 to unlock the case.

Purpose：
Player’s purpose in the morning scene is to find the wooden key. The player should put the photo pieces together correctly to get a complete picture. There are 3 photo pieces, and they are in the drawer of the cabinet of wall 1, above the lamp, and under the rug. Only if the player finds all three photo pieces and completes the photo will the wooden key come out. After that, the scene will change to afternoon immediately. 



In the afternoon scene: 

Facilities in the main room:
Wall 1: tv set, cabinet
Wall 2: curtain, sash
Wall 3: case, cabinet, switch
Wall 4: front door, rug
Ceiling: garret door, ceiling light
Dining table: a birthday cake without candles

Special:
There are no bugs anymore. The player can’t make a phone call even if the phone number is correct. Some words are shown on TV. There is only one family photo under the rug, and the player can get this by dragging for three times. After opening the sash, the player can follow the route shown on the treasure map. And a cake without candles is placed on the dining room table.

Purpose：
Player’s purpose in the afternoon scene is to find the steel key. The player should place the right number of candles on the cake, then ignite them. Candles can be obtained after getting out from the sash( Its key is placed inside the case of wall 3, when passcode: 20120117— the date of the car crash, which was hint in the newspaper found inside one of the drawers of the cabinet of wall 3,  is entered to unlock it) and arriving at the destination( The way leading to destination would be shown on the treasure map in one of the drawers of the cabinet of wall 3). In addition, matches are needed to light the candle, and the matches are placed in one of the drawers of the cabinet of wall 3. As in the previous scenario, once the player gets the steel key, the scene will change to evening immediately.



In the evening scene:

Facilities in the main room:
Wall 1: tv set, cabinet
Wall 2: curtain
Wall 3: case, cabinet
Wall 4: front door, basement door
Ceiling: garret door, ceiling light
Dining table: some vegetables and raw seafood, materials to make dinner

Special:
There would still be no bugs. However, the basement door will appear. The player will find that the curtain cannot be opened, thus cannot see the sash. The light switch on wall 3 also had disappeared.

Player’s purpose in the evening scene is to find the steel key and eventually make the escape from the garret. To reach the garret, a ladder is needed, which can be found in the basement. For access to the basement, one must find its key, which, along with the glass key can be found when the player dissects the fish (Which is among the seafood on the dining table. The clue would be given in the diary inside the case of wall 3— As wrote “Mom’s fish soup rocks!”). 




Basement:
A ladder is in the basement, and a wall of family photos.





Garret:
In the garret, there are four walls around: a red wall, a yellow wall, a blue wall, and one is made of crystal. And a purple pole is in the middle of the room.
There are three holes in the crystal wall, and the player needs to insert the keys (wooden key, steel key, glass key) obtained in the previous sections into the keyholes. The keys need to be lined correctly. Three numbers will be given: 2000, 0900, 1700—indicating time. The player can also get a little hint written in riddle:
To open the crystal wall
I need to line the keys
Maybe reflect on the past scenes
Everything one can then see
lining first letters together—TIME
or one can figure out by the meaning of the four lines
When the crystal wall is opened, it’ll be too high to climb down, so the player will need a rope.
In addition, there is a hole in each red wall, yellow wall and blue wall. The player needs to select two of the walls and insert two cylinders (stored in one of the drawers of the cabinet of wall 1 and the case of wall 3 in the main room). Note that the choice of the wall is based on the colors, which mixed together would be the pole’s color which is purple(red+blue), so the player needs to choose the red wall and the blue wall. Finally, when all plugins are plugged in, the rope will be provided. The player can leave the room by climbing down the rope.

Game Passed!




Bonus:
Morning:
In the morning, if the player gets close to the rug and manipulates the bug, he will find that he can’t touch the bug.
If the player can open the combination lock of the 4th drawer of the cabinet of wall 1(the passcode refers to the movements of the bugs), there will be a note inside that says: call377624, and the cake will be delivered after the call. If the player can open the door (The passcode to open the door will be hint if the player looks out of the peephole, which is “snz”) and get the cake, the cake will automatically be placed on the table (So the cake is delivered before the daughter and mom didn’t order it, though they’ll do it anyway, but this indicates “my” existence).

Afternoon:
When the player walks to the tv, on the tv screen, it will show: enter a tv number as “TV+number”, and then the player needs to follow the instructions to enter the three passwords correctly. If the password is entered correctly, the player will receive a message and a gift. 
If the player enters the case password 20120517(Which is exactly four months—hint in my words, after the car crash’s date— hint in the newspaper.) and puts the present into the empty case, it will fulfill the traditional treasure hunt mentioned in the diary (note that it can only be opened in the afternoon mode).
If the player drags the carpet three times, he will get a family photo of only two people (mother and daughter). And when the player enters the basement in the evening mode, it will automatically trigger the condition to post the family photo on the wall.

After the final clearance, the player— “I”, can regain memory and make a personal monologue to leave a note to my daughter.
